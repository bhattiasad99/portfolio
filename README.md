## About Me
I'm a frontend engineer who builds **fast, scalable, and user-focused web applications** using React and Next.js. With over **20 professional projects** across Real Estate, EdTech, Healthcare, and SaaS, I specialize in transforming business goals into performant, maintainable products.

Currently, I'm diving deep into **GraphQL and frontend performance optimization**, while mentoring junior developers and working on UI design systems.
