## 📑 Case Study 

### 🔥 Business Challenge  

Postal 247, a food ordering platform connecting restaurants, bikers, and customers, faced significant operational challenges that hindered its performance and user satisfaction. The primary issues included:  

🎯 **Unstable Applications:** Frequent crashes across both the React Native biker and user apps, leading to a disrupted user experience. <br>
🎯 **Inconsistent Data Structures:** Disparate data structures between the React Native apps and the React.js admin panel resulted in data inconsistencies and application failures.   <br>
🎯 **Lack of Development Environments:** Absence of separate environments for development, staging, and production led to untested features affecting live users.   <br>
🎯 **Undefined Firebase Functions:** Firebase functions were neither documented nor version-controlled, causing accidental overwrites and unpredictable system behavior.   <br>
🎯 **No Documentation:** The complete lack of documentation made onboarding new developers challenging and maintenance cumbersome.  <br>

### 💡 Our Solution  

As the technical consultant, I implemented a comprehensive strategy to revitalize Postal 247:  

✅ **Standardized Data Structures:** Developed Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, including use-case and swimlane activity diagrams, to visualize system interactions. Established an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to standardize data structures across all platforms, ensuring consistency and reducing application crashes.   <br>
✅ **Transition to SQL-Based Data Management:** Migrated from Firestore to an SQL-based data structure. Implemented class-based functions for database queries to enforce data integrity and streamline data operations.<br>
✅ **Implementation of Security Protocols:** Established robust security rules to ensure that only authorized class-based functions could interact with the database, enhancing data protection and system reliability.   <br>
✅ **Establishment of Development Pipelines:** Set up distinct pipelines for development, staging, and production environments. This segregation allowed for thorough testing and quality assurance before deploying features to live users.   <br>
✅ **Introduction of Project Management Tools:** Developed **Gantt charts** to outline project timelines and milestones. Implemented **user story mapping** and a **feature pipeline** to prioritize development tasks. Established a bug tracking and reporting system to promptly identify and address issues.   <br>
✅ **Definition of Non-Functional Requirements:** Outlined clear non-functional requirements focusing on performance optimization, scalability, and user experience to guide the development process and set measurable quality standards.   <br>
