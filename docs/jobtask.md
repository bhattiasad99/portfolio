## 📑 Case Study  

### 🔥 Business Challenge  

JobTask, a handyman service platform (for removals, cleaning, furniture assembly, deliveries, etc.), was facing major challenges:  

🔴 **Poor Design:** The outdated UI lacked professionalism, reducing user trust and engagement.  
🔴 **Project Overruns:** The previous development team consistently missed deadlines, causing delays and cost overruns.  
🔴 **Code Inconsistencies:** Multiple developers with varying styles left the codebase unstructured and difficult to maintain.  
🔴 **Lack of Code Reviews:** Without proper reviews, the code turned into "spaghetti code," making debugging and scaling hard.  

### 💡 Our Solution  

Our team (1 designer & 2 developers) systematically tackled these issues:  

✅ **Technology Upgrade:** Migrated frontend from **React.js → Next.js** for improved SEO and faster page loads.  
✅ **UI/UX Overhaul:** Redesigned the interface with a modern landing page, About Us section, and improved navigation.  
✅ **Codebase Refinement:** Refactored and optimized the entire codebase, enforcing coding standards and removing redundant code.  
✅ **Payment Integration:** Integrated **Stripe** for secure transactions, ensuring PCI compliance and user trust.  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation:** Created setup guides, API references, and code documentation for future scalability.  

### 👥 Team Setup  

👨‍🎨 **1 Designer** – Focused on UI/UX redesign, improving aesthetics and user journey.  
👨‍💻 **2 Developers** – Integrated Next.js frontend with the backend, added new APIs, and implemented third-party services.  

### 🛠 Technologies Used  

🚀 **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework) + Material-UI for a sleek, responsive design.  
🛠 **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js + MongoDB for scalable, document-oriented data storage.  
🔗 **Third-Party Integrations:**  
- 📲 **Vonage (Nexmo):** OTP verification for secure user authentication.  
- 💳 **Stripe:** Seamless and secure payment processing.  
- ✉️ **SendGrid:** Email notifications for user confirmations.  
- 💬 **Socket.io:** Real-time chat features between customers and service providers.  

### 📊 Results & Impact  

🚀 **Faster Load Time:** Next.js optimization significantly reduced load time, improving user experience.  
🛠 **Cleaner Codebase:** Refactoring and structured development allow easier debugging and feature expansion.  
💡 **Enhanced User Experience:** The intuitive UI/UX led to increased engagement and positive user feedback.  
📈 **Better Scalability:** The new architecture supports future growth, making it easy to expand features.
