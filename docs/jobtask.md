## 📑 Case Study  

### 🔥 Business Challenge  

JobTask, a handyman service platform (for removals, cleaning, furniture assembly, deliveries, etc.), was facing major challenges:  

🔴 **Poor Design:** The outdated UI lacked professionalism, reducing user trust and engagement.  
🔴 **Project Overruns:** The previous development team consistently missed deadlines, causing delays and cost overruns.  
🔴 **Code Inconsistencies:** Multiple developers with varying styles left the codebase unstructured and difficult to maintain.  
🔴 **Lack of Code Reviews:** Without proper reviews, the code turned into "spaghetti code," making debugging and scaling hard.
