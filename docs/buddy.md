## 📑 Case Study 

### 🔥 Business Challenge  

Our software company faced several project management challenges:  

🎯 **Inefficient Stand-Up Meetings:** Daily stand-up meetings consumed substantial time, often deviating from agendas and affecting productivity.  
🎯 **Reactive Decision-Making:** Without real-time insights, management decisions were often reactive rather than proactive.  
🎯 **Unresolved Roadblocks:** Team members facing obstacles lacked a streamlined process to seek timely assistance, leading to delays.   

### 💡 Our Solution  

To address these challenges, we conceptualized and developed Buddy, an AI-driven project management assistant designed to emulate the roles of a traditional project manager:​  

✅ **AI-Powered Task Management:** Buddy automates task assignments, monitors progress, and adjusts workloads based on real-time data, ensuring optimal resource utilization.  
✅ **Virtual Stand-Up Meetings:** Utilizing natural language processing, Buddy conducts virtual stand-up meetings, gathers updates from team members, and summarizes key points, reducing meeting times and enhancing focus.<br>
✅ **Comprehensive Attendance and Task Logging:** The attendance module requires users to log tasks performed and time spent before signing out, creating a detailed dataset for performance analysis and overrun reduction.  
✅ **Proactive Roadblock Resolution:** Buddy detects when team members encounter obstacles and automatically schedules meetings with relevant stakeholders, such as tech leads, to facilitate prompt resolutions.  
✅ **Automated Meeting Documentation:** During meetings, Buddy records discussions, transcribes content, and generates detailed meeting minutes, ensuring accurate documentation and easy retrieval of information.
✅ **Data-Driven Insights:** Buddy analyzes collected data to provide actionable insights, enabling proactive decision-making and continuous process improvement.
